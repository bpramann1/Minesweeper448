Meeting outcomes:
- during final check of project noticed bug causing flagged tiles to be flipped and become innactive. This causes the player to no longer be able
 to win the game and must either restart or intentionally lose the game. 
- fixed bug on branch gitTest by modifying board.py flip() function to check for flagged tiles as well as tiles with no mines.
this however seemed to produce unintended consequences sometimes resulting in strange behavior of game end states
new issues: -marking all bombs and only bombs will sometimes not cause a win game to trigger.
	    -flagging empty spaces, then flagging all bombs, then removing flagged empty spaces will not trigger winning game unless bomb spaces
	     are unflagged then flagged again. NOTE: This did not always fix the issue, and it is difficult to say exactly what sequence of events
	     will trigger this bug
